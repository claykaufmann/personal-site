This is my photography portfolio website. It has my photography portfolio, allowing people to see my best photography work. It also contains a short bit about me. Live site available at [https://photo.claykaufmann.com](https://photo.claykaufmann.com).

## Tech Stack

- NextJS/React in typescript
- ChakraUI for styling
- Docker for deployment
- AWS S3 Buckets for photo storage

## Use of AWS

The website interacts with an S3 bucket in order to collect the photos on a user request.
