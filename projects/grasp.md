This is the Game and Repository for Aperture Solutions and Patterns. It was developed as a joint project between the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and UVM. There were two lead developers on the project, myself and Ryan Joseph. Live site available at [https://www.grasp-game.org](https://www.grasp-game.org).

I built this project as part of my internship with NASA Goddard. Ryan Joseph built the initial version of the site, and upon the beginning of my internship in August 2021, I began to revamp it, adding many more features to the site, until the end of my internship, December 2021.

The goal of the website is for users to find Golomb patterns, a type of pattern extremely useful in placing telescopes/sat dishes in arrays for taking images of deep space.

## Tech Stack

This is a classic LAMP stack project.

## Development

Being a LAMP stack project, all aspects of the LAMP stack were used. mySQL for the database, PHP for querying the database and generating HTML, on an apache webserver on a linux machine.
